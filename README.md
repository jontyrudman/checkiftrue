# CheckIfTrue Twitter Bot

Only online for testing - will be online permanently once API keys for @CheckIfTrue are issued.

## Usage - Twitter Bot

Tweet @CheckIfTrue with the handle at the beginning or end of a plain tweet, containing a claim you'd like to determine the truthfulness of.
The bot will retweet with a comment saying whether the statement is likely to be true or false.

Currently, when online for testing, the handle is replaced with #factcheckbot and my account (@JontySR) replies.
